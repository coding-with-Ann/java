package packages;
//package is basically a grouping of related types providing access protection.
//Now types can classes , interfaces, nested classes etc.
//package name cannot be a keyword.
//packages follow the naming conventions like test.package1 , test.package2 to maintain the hierarchy.
//For enterprise apps Reverse the domain name and you can use it as a package name.
//For example google.com can be written as com.google.web.frontend
//If you make a class as public the class is visible to all packages.
//If public is not provided then the class is visible only in that package.
