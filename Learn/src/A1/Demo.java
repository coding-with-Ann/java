//DataStructutes is a way to organise data so that it would be easy to process it.
//From unorganized books in library, it will be difficult to access a particular book.
// If it is organized then we can access a particular book easily.

//There are two types of data structures.
//LInear data structures and non linear data structures.

//LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES (ARRAYS, LINKED LIST, STACK AND QUEUE)
//Elements are stored in sequential order and each 
//element is connected to its previous and next element.
//Stored in single level.

//NON LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES (GRAPHS AND TREES)
//Data elements are not in sequential order.
//They are basically connected to one other through different paths
//Stored in multilevel.

//ALGORITHMS are set of instructions or steps to perform a particular task.
//Its like steps performed in making tea.
