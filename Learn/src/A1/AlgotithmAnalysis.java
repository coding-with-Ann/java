//There are two complexities that decides that how best is the algorithm.
//Time complexity and space complexity

//The amount of time taken by an algorithm to run is called time complexity.
//The amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run is space complexity.

//Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating
//performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and its increase.
