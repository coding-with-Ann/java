package ClassObject;

//Class Object
//Object is also a class in java. It is the super super class of any class you create in java.
//Any class you create in java, it is automatically inherited by the object class.
//Object class defines equals() method which indicates weather this object is equals to this object or not.
//Object class also defines hashCode() method which returns hash code value for the object.
//These methods have concrete implementation available inside the object class.
//Remember hash set uses equals() method to maintain uniqueness. 
//You can maintain uniqueness in an hashset if it is a built-in datatype like integer, string etc.
//Java maintains uniqueness using both equals() and hashcode.
