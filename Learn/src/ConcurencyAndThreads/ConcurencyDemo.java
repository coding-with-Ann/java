package ConcurencyAndThreads;

//As a developer you expect multiple programs to run in parallel and that is the idea about concurency.
//How do we work with concurrency in java is with the help of processes and threads.
//A PROCESS is a stand alone execution environment.
//Process has all the runtime resources and memory it needs.

//THREADS are light weight processes. Both processes and threads has execution environment
//but creating a thread requires a lot less resources than creating a process.
//A process can have multiple threads. Threads always exists within a process.
//There will be atleast one thread in a process and each thread is a task.
//Multiple threads run at the sametime to create a better experience.
//In a racing game there are different threads to show the speed, fuel etc. 
//All these threads needs to run at the same time in your program to experience the complete game.
//This is what when we say multithreading. We want the multiple threads to get better user experience.
