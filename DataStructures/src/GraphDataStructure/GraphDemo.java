//Graph is a data Structure which is derived from concepts of mathematics
//Graph is a collection of vertices and edges
//Vertices represent data and edges represent the relation b/w vertices
//There are different types of graphs having different uses 
//Directed graph(no direction arrow) and undirected graph(There is a direction arrow.
//connected and disconnected graph

//   .A------.B       The line b/w A and V is a edge shows relation b/w A and B
