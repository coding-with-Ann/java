//Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure. It means the tree can have at least two children
//Binary tree has atmost two children ******
//Top element is root and can't access every element using indexes
//EXAMPLE: FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY

//Common traversal methods
// preorder(root) : print- left-right
// postorder(root): left-right-print
//inorder(root)   : left-print-right
