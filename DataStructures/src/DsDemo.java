//Data Structures is a way to arrange data in computers
//It helps in better memory and CPU utilization

//Two types of DataStructures
//1. Linear DataStructures (Arrays,LinkedList, Stack, Queue) 
//2. NonLinear DataStructures (Trees, Graphs)

//Disadvantages of array are arrays are stored in contiguous memory location
//and arrays have fixed size so we can over come this in linked list.

//In linked list size is variable and doesn't need contiguous memory location

//Stack -- LIFO(Insertion and deletion of elements is performed)
//Queue -- FIFO
